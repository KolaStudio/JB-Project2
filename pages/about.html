            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p> My name is Ayelet Kol. As a student who unexpectedly found my way into the realm of code and web
                development, my journey has
                been as unique as it is fulfilling. My entry into this field came about when I aimed to create a
                platform to exhibit my talent as a graphic designer and illustrator.

                Blessed with a diverse background in art, 3D animation, and now, web development, I possess a blend of
                artistic sensibility and technical prowess. This multi-disciplinary blend forms a robust skill set,
                fueling my ability to tackle a variety of challenges with creativity and precision.

                My hands-on experience spans across several web development projects, one of which has successfully
                attracted thousands of subscribers. Each of these experiences has served as a valuable stepping stone in
                my learning journey, constantly refining my skills.

                This website is a result of my continued quest for knowledge. Crafted during a comprehensive full stack
                course, it serves as a testament to my dedication to learning and sharpening my programming skills.

                My journey continues as I delve deeper into the intricate world of programming, constantly pushing the
