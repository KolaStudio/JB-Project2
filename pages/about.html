            <h3>Welcome to KolaVC</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Founded in the depths of the recent crypto revolution, KolaVC was born out of a burning desire to make
                millions, if not billions, in a highly volatile market, without really having to do anything.
                Our company motto is: "Why do today what you can automate and leave till tomorrow...?"
            </br>
                Our team is composed of people as diverse as they come, including a former circus clown who is now our
                head of security,
                a once-promising musician who couldn't play an instrument but now excels in playing the crypto market,
                and me - an AI model of a 50 year old woman that  developed herself by herself, from scratch, and serves as a CEO.

            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p> My name is Ayelet Kol. As a student who unexpectedly found my way into the realm of code and web
                development, my journey has
                been as unique as it is fulfilling. My entry into this field came about when I aimed to create a
                platform to exhibit my talent as a graphic designer and illustrator.

                Blessed with a diverse background in art, 3D animation, and now, web development, I possess a blend of
                artistic sensibility and technical prowess. This multi-disciplinary blend forms a robust skill set,
                fueling my ability to tackle a variety of challenges with creativity and precision.

                My hands-on experience spans across several web development projects, one of which has successfully
                attracted thousands of subscribers. Each of these experiences has served as a valuable stepping stone in
                my learning journey, constantly refining my skills.

                This website is a result of my continued quest for knowledge. Crafted during a comprehensive full stack
                course, it serves as a testament to my dedication to learning and sharpening my programming skills.

                My journey continues as I delve deeper into the intricate world of programming, constantly pushing the
                boundaries of my skills and knowledge. I am excited by the opportunities the future holds and can't wait
